* Ecclesiology (the study of the church's nature, structure, and mission)
* Missiology (the study of Christian mission and evangelism)

**Essential Texts and Sources:**

**Methodological Approach:**

* Historical-critical method: analyzing the biblical texts within their historical context
* Social-scientific criticism: examining the social and cultural dynamics of the Thessalonian church
* Theological reflection: integrating theological concepts and themes with historical and social analysis
* Reflective practice: encouraging students to engage personally and thoughtfully with the subject matter, considering implications for contemporary Christian theology and practice

To achieve a reflective tone in their final paper, students should be encouraged to:

* Engage deeply with the historical context of the Thessalonian church
* Analyze the theological concepts and themes that emerge from this context
* Consider the implications of their findings for contemporary Christian theology and practice
* Offer personal reflections and insights throughout the paper, using first-person narration when appropriate
* Use a conversational tone while maintaining academic rigor and clarity

The 1500-2000 word requirement allows for a nuanced exploration of the Thessalonian church's historical context, with sufficient depth to engage key theological concepts and themes. By following this outline, students will develop a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter and cultivate a reflective approach to theological inquiry.
