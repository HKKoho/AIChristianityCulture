    **Assignment Plan: Two Traditional Interpretations of Bible - Single-source and Dual-source Approach**

**Thesis Statement:** This paper will examine the single-source and dual-source approaches to biblical interpretation, two traditional methodologies that have shaped the understanding of scripture in the context of church history (教會歷史), highlighting their key similarities and differences, and evaluating their implications for theological inquiry.

**Research Question:** How do the single-source and dual-source approaches to biblical interpretation reflect distinct theological perspectives, and what are the consequences of these approaches for our understanding of scripture and its role in shaping Christian doctrine and practice?

**Main Sections:**

1. **Introduction to Biblical Interpretation** (approx. 200-250 words)
	* Introduce the importance of biblical interpretation in theology
	* Provide an overview of the single-source and dual-source approaches
	* Thesis statement and research question
2. **The Single-Source Approach** (approx. 400-450 words)
	* Define and explain the single-source approach to biblical interpretation
	* Discuss key proponents and their contributions (e.g., Augustine, Calvin)
	* Examine the strengths and weaknesses of this approach
3. **The Dual-Source Approach** (approx. 400-450 words)
	* Define and explain the dual-source approach to biblical interpretation
	* Discuss key proponents and their contributions (e.g., Thomas Aquinas, Luther)
	* Examine the strengths and weaknesses of this approach
4. **Comparison and Evaluation** (approx. 500-550 words)
	* Compare and contrast the single-source and dual-source approaches
	* Evaluate the implications of each approach for theological inquiry
	* Discuss the consequences of these approaches for Christian doctrine and practice
5. **Conclusion** (approx. 150-200 words)
	* Summarize the main points
	* Reiterate the thesis statement and research question
	* Offer final thoughts on the significance of these approaches for biblical interpretation

**Key Theological Concepts:**

* Inspiration and authority of scripture
* Role of tradition and reason in interpretation
* Relationship between faith and reason
* Nature of revelation and its implications for theology

**Essential Texts, Scriptures, or Theological Sources:**

* Biblical passages (e.g., 2 Timothy 3:16-17, Romans 1:19-20)
* Early church fathers (e.g., Augustine's "On Christian Doctrine")
* Reformation-era theologians (e.g., Calvin's "Institutes", Luther's "Bondage of the Will")
* Thomas Aquinas' "Summa Theologica"
* Contemporary theological works (e.g., Alister McGrath's "The Genesis of Doctrine")

**Methodological Approach:**

* Historical-critical method for understanding the development of biblical interpretation
* Theological analysis for evaluating the implications of each approach
* Comparative methodology for examining the similarities and differences between the single-source and dual-source approaches

To meet the 1500-2000 word requirement, students should aim to provide a detailed and nuanced exploration of the two traditional interpretations of Bible, engaging with a range of theological sources and concepts. The scope and depth of the assignment will require students to demonstrate a strong understanding of church history, biblical interpretation, and theological inquiry.

**Tips for Developing an Academic Tone:**

* Use technical vocabulary and theological terminology accurately
* Engage with a range of primary and secondary sources
* Employ a formal and objective tone, avoiding personal opinions and biases
* Use proper citation and referencing throughout the paper
* Ensure clarity and coherence in writing, using transitional phrases and sentences to connect ideas.
