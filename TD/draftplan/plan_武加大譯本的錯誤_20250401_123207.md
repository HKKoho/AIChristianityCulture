**Key Theological Concepts:**

* Scripture: the nature and authority of scripture, including issues related to translation and interpretation.
* Tradition: the role of tradition in shaping Christian doctrine and practice, and how it interacts with scripture.
* Authority: the relationship between scripture, tradition, and ecclesiastical authority, particularly in the context of biblical translation.

**Essential Texts and Sources:**

* The 武加大譯本 (Wu Ga Da Yi Ben) translation of the Bible
* Other Chinese translations of the Bible (e.g. Union Version, Chinese Standard Bible)
* Historical texts related to the development of Christianity in China (e.g. works by missionaries, church historians)
* Theological sources such as Augustine's "On Christian Doctrine" and Luther's "On Translation: An Open Letter"

**Methodological Approach:**

* Critical analysis of primary and secondary sources, including biblical translations, historical texts, and theological treatises.
* Use of textual criticism to identify and analyze errors in the 武加大譯本.
* Engagement with relevant theological frameworks and concepts to understand the implications of translation errors for church history and doctrine.
* Comparative analysis of different Chinese translations of the Bible to contextualize the significance of the 武加大譯本.

To achieve an academic tone, students should:

* Use technical vocabulary and concepts specific to theology and biblical studies (e.g. hermeneutics, exegesis, eisegesis).
* Engage with a range of primary and secondary sources, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the historical and theological context.
* Employ critical thinking and analytical skills to evaluate evidence and arguments.
* Present their findings in a clear, well-organized, and logically coherent manner.

The 1500-2000 word requirement allows for a comprehensive analysis of the topic, with sufficient depth to explore key issues and concepts. Students should aim to provide a balanced treatment of historical, theological, and textual aspects, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the complex dynamics at play in the transmission of scripture.
